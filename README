# robocompdsl

robocompdsl tool with ros2 support

# DEPENDENCY

robocomp, ros-melodic, ros-eloquent, stringcase (python)

# INSTALLATION

- clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/ksakash/robocompdsl

- bin/robocompdsl is the new script that supports ros1 and ros2

- in order to use this script from any where in your machine you can create an alias to use the
  script from this repo (bin/robocompdsl) instead of the one installed by robocomp

$ vim ~/.bashrc
$ alias temprobocompdsl=/path/to/your/bin/robocompdsl

# USAGE

- to try out the new script you have two options:
  1. use the alias
        or
  2. use the script in the repo

- let's use the script in the repo and demonstrate a couple of examples. in the example dir there
  are different subdirs which contains a .cdsl file to create a component, each with different
  middleware

- to create a component enter the dir where the .cdsl file is and follow these steps:
  $ ../../bin/robocompdsl component.cdsl .
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake .. && make

  NOTE: 1. before creating ros1 component: $ source /opt/melodic/setup.bash
        2. before creating ros2 component: $ source /opt/eloquent/setup.bash
                                   $ export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$AMENT_PREFIX_PATH:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH

- if the component builds without a compilation error then it was a success
